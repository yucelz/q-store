# CRITICAL: Never commit source if you're distributing binaries
# But we want to track source in our private repo, so DON'T add:
# src/q_store/**/*.py  <-- Don't ignore source in your private repo!

# However, if you create a PUBLIC repo for distribution, you would add:
# src/  <-- Exclude entire source directory from public repo
